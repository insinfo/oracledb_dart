Troubleshooting Errors
**********************

Use the troubleshooting information documented in this section to address
common errors that may appear while :ref:`installing <instllntroubleshooting>`
or :ref:`using <runtimetroubleshooting>` python-oracledb.

This chapter does not list all possible errors.

.. _instllntroubleshooting:

Installation Errors
===================

You may encounter issues while installing python-oracledb. Review the
python-oracledb :ref:`instreq`. To understand the problem better, you can
display more output by using the ``-v`` option with the pip install command.
Review your output and logs.

If you need to modify your system version of Python and do not have the
necessary access to modify it, then use:

.. code-block:: shell

    python -m pip install oracledb --upgrade --user

Or you can use the venv module (built into Python 3.x).

This section covers some specific errors or problems that you may run into
during python-oracledb installation, and possible solutions to resolve them.

If the installation problem still persists, then try to install
python-oracledb using a different method. **Google anything that looks like an
error.** Try some potential solutions.

.. _wheelerr:

"Not a supported wheel on this platform" Error
----------------------------------------------

**Cause:**  The python-oracledb installation failed with this error because
you may be using an older version of ``pip``.

**Action:** Upgrade your pip version with the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    python -m pip install pip --upgrade --user

.. _networkerr:

Network Connection Error
------------------------

**Cause:**  The python-oracledb installation failed because of a network
connection error.

**Action:** To resolve this issue:

- Check if you need to set the environment variables ``http_proxy`` and/or
  ``https_proxy``.

- Or try the following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

        python -m pip install --proxy=http://proxy.example.com:80 oracledb --upgrade

.. _upgradeerr:

Upgrade to Latest Version Failed Without Any Errors
---------------------------------------------------

**Cause:**  The upgrade to the latest python-oracledb version failed without
any errors because the old version is still installed.

**Action:** To reinstall the latest version, try the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    python -m pip install oracledb --upgrade --force-reinstall

.. _nomodpiperr:

"No module named pip" Error
---------------------------

**Cause:**  The python-oracledb installation failed with this error because
the pip module that is built into Python may sometimes be removed by the OS.

**Action:** Instead, use the venv module (built into Python 3.x) or virtualenv
module.

.. _dpiherr:

"fatal error: dpi.h: No such file or directory" Error
-----------------------------------------------------

**Cause:**  The python-oracledb installation from source code failed because a
subdirectory called "odpi" may be missing.

**Action:** Check if your source installation has a subdirectory called
"odpi" containing files. If this is missing, review the section on
:ref:`installgh`.

.. _warningmsgs:

Warning Messages
================

Some warnings may appear while using python-oracledb in Thick or Thin mode.

.. _pythwarning:

Deprecated Python Version Warning
---------------------------------

**Warning:** ``Python 3.6 is no longer supported by the Python core team.
Therefore, support for it is deprecated in python-oracledb and will be removed
in a future release.`` (A similar warning will also be displayed for Python
versions 3.7 and 3.8.)

**Cause:** ``import oracledb`` gives this warning because you are using a
version of Python that is longer maintained by the Python core team.

**Action:**  You can either:

- Upgrade your Python version to 3.9 or later.

- Or you can temporarily suppress the warning by importing the
  `warnings <https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html>`__ module and
  adding a call like ``warnings.filterwarnings(action='ignore',
  module="oracledb")`` *before* importing ``oracledb``.

- Install an older version of python-oracledb

.. _runtimetroubleshooting:

Error Messages
==============

While using python-oracledb in Thin or Thick mode, you may encounter
errors. Some common :ref:`DPI <dpierr>`, :ref:`DPY <dpyerr>`, and :ref:`ORA
<oraerr>` errors are detailed in this section with information about the
probable cause of the error, and the recommended action which may resolve the
error.

If you have multiple versions of Python installed, ensure that you are
using the correct python and pip (or python3 and pip3) executables.

.. _dpierr:

DPI Error Messages
------------------

The error messages with prefix ``DPI`` are generated by the
`ODPI-C <https://oracle.github.io/odpi/>`_ code which is used by the
python-oracledb Thick mode.

Some common DPI error messages are discussed below.

.. _dpi1047:

DPI-1047
++++++++

**Message:** ``DPI-1047: Oracle Client library cannot be loaded``

**Cause:**   The connection to Oracle Database failed because the Oracle
Client library could not be loaded.

**Action:**  Perform the following steps:

- Review the :ref:`features available in python-oracledb's default Thin mode
  <featuresummary>`. If Thin mode suits your requirements, then remove the
  calls in your application to :meth:`oracledb.init_oracle_client()` since
  this loads the Oracle Client library to :ref:`enable Thick mode
  <enablingthick>`.

- On Windows and macOS, pass the ``lib_dir`` library directory parameter
  in your :meth:`oracledb.init_oracle_client()` call. The parameter
  should be the location of your Oracle Client libraries. Do not pass
  this parameter on Linux.

- Check if the Python process has permission to open the Oracle Client
  libraries. OS restrictions may prevent the opening of libraries installed
  in unsafe paths, such as from a user directory. On Linux you may need to
  install the Oracle Client libraries under a directory like ``/opt`` or
  ``/usr/local``.

- Check if Python and your Oracle Client libraries are both 64-bit or
  both 32-bit. The ``DPI-1047`` message will tell you whether the 64-bit
  or 32-bit Oracle Client is needed for your Python.

- Set the environment variable ``DPI_DEBUG_LEVEL`` to 64 and restart
  python-oracledb. The trace messages will show how and where
  python-oracledb is looking for the Oracle Client libraries.

  At a Windows command prompt, this could be done with::

        set DPI_DEBUG_LEVEL=64

  On Linux and macOS, you might use::

        export DPI_DEBUG_LEVEL=64

- On Windows:

  - If you have a full database installation, ensure that this database is the
    `currently configured database <https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?
    ctx=db21&id=RIWIN-GUID-33D575DD-47FF-42B1-A82F-049D3F2A8791>`__.

  - If you are not passing a library directory parameter to
    :meth:`oracledb.init_oracle_client()`, then restart your command prompt
    and use ``set PATH`` to check if the environment variable has the correct
    Oracle Client listed before any other Oracle directories.

  - Use the ``DIR`` command to verify that ``OCI.DLL`` exists in the directory
    passed to :meth:`oracledb.init_oracle_client()` or set in ``PATH``.

  - Check if the correct `Windows Redistributables <https://oracle.github.io/odpi/
    doc/installation.html#windows>`__ have been installed.

- On Linux:

  - Check if the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable contains the Oracle
    Client library directory. Some environments such as web servers and
    daemons reset environment variables.

  - If you are using Oracle Instant Client, a preferred alternative to
    ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` is to ensure that a file in the ``/etc/ld.so.conf.d``
    directory contains the path to the Instant Client directory, and then run
    ``ldconfig``.

DPI-1072
++++++++

**Message:** ``DPI-1072: the Oracle Client library version is unsupported``

**Cause:**  The connection to Oracle Database failed because the Oracle Client
library version used is not supported by python-oracledb Thick mode. The Thick
mode needs Oracle Client library 11.2 or later. Note that version 19 is not
supported on Windows 7.

**Action:** Review the :ref:`instreq`. You can either:

- Follow the steps documented in :ref:`DPI-1047 <dpi1047>` which may help.

- Or may be use python-oracledb Thin mode which can be done by removing calls
  to :meth:`oracledb.init_oracle_client()` from your code.

.. _dpyerr:

DPY Error Messages
------------------

The python-oracledb Thin mode code and python-oracledb Thick mode code
generates error messages with the prefix ``DPY``.

Some common DPY error messages are discussed below.

.. _dpy3001:

DPY-3001
++++++++

**Message:** ``DPY-3001: Native Network Encryption and Data Integrity is only
supported in python-oracledb thick mode``

**Action:** To verify if NNE or checksumming are enabled, you can use the
following query::

    SELECT network_service_banner FROM v$session_connect_info;

If NNE is enabled, then this query prints output that includes the
available encryption service, the crypto-checksumming service, and the
algorithms in use, such as::

    NETWORK_SERVICE_BANNER
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TCP/IP NT Protocol Adapter for Linux: Version 19.0.0.0.0 - Production
    Encryption service for Linux: Version 19.0.1.0.0 - Production
    AES256 Encryption service adapter for Linux: Version 19.0.1.0.0 - Production
    Crypto-checksumming service for Linux: Version 19.0.1.0.0 - Production
    SHA256 Crypto-checksumming service adapter for Linux: Version 19.0.1.0.0 - Production

If NNE is not enabled, then the query will only print the available encryption
and crypto-checksumming services in the output. For example::

    NETWORK_SERVICE_BANNER
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TCP/IP NT Protocol Adapter for Linux: Version 19.0.0.0.0 - Production
    Encryption service for Linux: Version 19.0.1.0.0 - Production

If NNE or checksumming are enabled, you can resolve this error by either:

- Changing the architecture to use Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is
  supported in python-oracledb Thin and Thick modes. See `Configuring
  Transport Layer Security Encryption
  <https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-8B82DD7E-7189-4FE9-8F3B-4E521706E1E4>`__.
- Or :ref:`enabling python-oracledb Thick mode <enablingthick>`.

.. seealso::

    `Oracle Database Security Guide <https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?
    ctx=dblatest&id=DBSEG>`__ for more information about Oracle Data Network
    Encryption and Integrity, and for information about configuring TLS
    network encryption.

DPY-3010
++++++++

**Message:** ``DPY-3010: connections to this database server version are not
supported by python-oracledb in thin mode``

**Cause:**  The connection to Oracle Database with python-oracledb Thin mode
failed because you are using Oracle Database version 11.2 or earlier. Using
python-oracledb Thin mode, you can connect directly to Oracle Database 12.1
or later.

**Action:** You can either:

- :ref:`Enable python-oracledb Thick mode <enablingthick>` since this mode can
  connect to Oracle Database 9.2 or later. For Thick mode, you need to install
  Oracle Client libraries and call :meth:`oracledb.init_oracle_client()` in
  your code.

- Upgrade your Oracle database to python-oracledb Thin mode supported versions
  12.1 or later.

DPY-3015
++++++++

**Message:** ``DPY-3015: password verifier type 0x939 is not supported by
python-oracledb in thin mode``

**Cause:**  The connection to Oracle Database with python-oracledb Thin mode
failed because your user account was only created with the 10G password
verifier. The python-oracledb Thin mode supports password verifiers 11G and
later.

**Action:** You can either:

- :ref:`Enable Thick mode <enablingthick>` since python-oracledb Thick mode
  supports password verifiers 10G and later.

- Or you can:

  1. Ensure that the database initialization parameter
     ``sec_case_sensitive_logon`` is not *FALSE*. To check the value, connect
     as SYSDBA in SQL*Plus and run::

        show parameter sec_case_sensitive_logon

    Note this parameter has been `removed in Oracle Database 21c
    <https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/nfcon/
    security-solutions.html#GUID-FAF4C7A6-A2CD-4B9B-9A64-3705F693ECF0>`__
    so only step 2 is required for this, or subsequent, database versions.

  2. Regenerate passwords for users who have old password verifiers. You can
     find such users with the query:

     .. code-block:: sql

        select username from dba_users
        where (password_versions = '10G ' or password_versions = '10G HTTP ')
        and username <> 'ANONYMOUS';

     You can reset passwords for these users with commands like::

        alter user x identified by y

     .. seealso::

        `Finding and Resetting User Passwords That Use the 10G Password
        Version <https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=
        GUID-D7B09DFE-F55D-449A-8F8A-174D89936304>`__ for more information.

DPY-3029
++++++++

**Message:** ``DPY-3029: "{name}" includes characters that are not allowed``

**Cause:** Characters were used that are not supported by Oracle Net in the
shown connection or configuration parameter or attribute.

**Action:** Values should be ASCII letters or digits. Allowed special
characters are ``'<>/,.:;-_$+*#&!%?@``. Values should not contain enclosing
quotes. Also remove trailing commas and trailing backslashes.

DPY-4011
++++++++

**Message:** ``DPY-4011: the database or network closed the connection``

**Cause:** If this occurs when using an already opened connection, additional
messages may indicate a reason.

If the error occurs when creating a connection or connection pool with
python-oracledb 2 or earlier, the common cause is that Oracle Database has
Native Network Encryption (NNE) enabled.  NNE and Oracle Net checksumming are
only supported in python-oracledb Thick mode.

**Action:** Review if NNE or checksumming are enabled. See
:ref:`DPY-3001 <dpy3001>` for solutions.

If additional messages indicate a reason, follow their guidance.

.. _oraerr:

ORA Error Messages
------------------

A common ORA error message is discussed below.

ORA-00933
+++++++++

**Message:** ``ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended`` or
``ORA-00933: unexpected keyword at or near <keyword_value>``

**Cause:** Commonly this error occurs when the SQL statement passed to Oracle
Database contains a trailing semicolon.

**Action:** If your code is like:

.. code-block:: python

    cursor.execute("select * from dept;")

Then remove the trailing semi-colon:

.. code-block:: python

    cursor.execute("select * from dept")

Note with Oracle Database 23ai this incorrect usage gives the message
``ORA-03048: SQL reserved word ';' is not syntactically valid following
'select * from dept'``.

.. seealso::
